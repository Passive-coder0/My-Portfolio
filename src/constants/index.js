export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior full stack developer who fell in love with coding the moment I wrote my first "Hello, World!" Itâ€™s been an incredible journey starting from the basics of HTML and CSS to building full-stack web applications with React, Node.js, and MongoDB.

Every project Iâ€™ve worked on has been a step forward, from crafting my own portfolio site to creating a nice weather app. And recently, I built a Full-Stack Notes app with React, ExpressJs and mongoDB; that allows users to create, edit, organize, and store notes digitally.

What I love most about development is bringing ideas to life and creating things that people can actually use and enjoy. Iâ€™m always eager to learn, grow, and take on new challenges. Letâ€™s build something amazing together! ðŸ˜Š`;
